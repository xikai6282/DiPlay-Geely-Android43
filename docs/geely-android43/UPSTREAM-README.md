# DiPlay

**CarPlay for compatible BYD Android head units.** Wired and wireless, with the familiar DiAuto interface. Independent app: `com.shihab.diplay`.

> **BYD support scope:** These projects focus on BYD cars. They may work on other brands, but other brands are unsupported and there are no plans to add support or fix brand-specific incompatibilities.

## 0.2.10 — public preview

Install on the **car**, not the iPhone. No jailbreak, dongle, Mac, account or authentication server is required for use. Core CarPlay does not require ADB; optional dashboard, battery, wheel-speed and parked-video features do. Your head unit must permit APK installation. Wireless supports Wi-Fi Direct or the car’s existing hotspot; Wi-Fi Direct requires Android 10+; the APK supports Android 9+ for wired use.

- Wired USB and wireless CarPlay with local authentication.
- BYD HUD navigation with arrows, distance and street names on verified firmware.
- Car hotspot support, improved audio buffering and saved receive diagnostics.
- Automatic address discovery, fixed-channel Wi-Fi fallbacks and successful-configuration memory.
- Icon/text size, resolution and frame rate; applying a display change reconnects CarPlay.
- Local diagnostic export. Reports are sent only if you choose to share them.
- Separate installation alongside DiAuto. Run one projection app at a time.

This is **not an Apple-certified product**. The APK bundles an experimental accessory identity recovered from public Carlinkit firmware, not a newly provisioned MFi identity for DiPlay. A bundled private key is extractable. Acceptance after future iOS updates, reliability across head units and suitability of that identity for general distribution are unresolved. This release invites community testing; it is not a guarantee of universal compatibility.

Earlier releases were tested on the development DiLink5.1 car: live windshield guidance and street names work, Car hotspot now starts CarPlay, and Wi-Fi Direct performance is substantially improved. Occasional audio cutouts remain and are deferred to a later update. The floating-map test build was installed on the development DiLink 5.1 car; feedback led to the pinch corrections in 0.2.9. Earlier wheel-speed and video contributions were tested on a BYD Tang with DiLink 5.0 and an iPhone 15 Pro on iOS 27; wheel-speed dead reckoning in tunnels remains unverified. Broader head-unit and iOS compatibility is not guaranteed. The HUD firmware scope and cleanup limits are documented in [BYD navigation](docs/BYD_NAVIGATION.md).

## What’s new in 0.2.10

- CarPlay song metadata, playback position and album artwork for compatible Android launchers and media displays.
- Available-port selection when another service occupies AirPlay port 7000, with the selected port advertised to the iPhone.
- Targeted USBMUX padding handling that preserves complete following frames, and USB startup without completed wireless-hotspot settings.
- Wi-Fi Direct compatibility for unknown reported security types, bounded busy-channel retries and 5 GHz to 2.4 GHz fallback.
- Available Android echo cancellation and noise suppression during CarPlay calls, with previous audio mode restored afterward.
- BYD CAN/CANFD battery-protocol detection and a saved show/hide setting for the home-screen dashboard-map mirror.
- Optional video while in P uses a new player with seeking and ten-second skip controls. URL validation and redirects protect local Android resources; protected video remains unsupported.
- More Ukrainian translations and bounded Bluetooth, USB restart, boot and microphone diagnostics in exported reports.

Optional video requires network ADB and a valid parked-gear reading. Battery, dashboard and call effects depend on firmware and Android support. See [0.2.10 release notes](docs/RELEASE-NOTES-0.2.10.md) for all ten contributions, regression fixes and validation limits. Existing device-specific wireless loss, microphone and reconnect reports still need hardware testing.

This repository starts with a clean public source snapshot. Local research, tester reports and release-signing secrets are excluded. The complete source corresponding to the APK is provided with every release; experimental runtime identity assets are described separately in the build instructions and notices.

## Local release packaging

The release APK intentionally contains the experimental accessory identity. The Git repository and source archive exclude all accessory and Android signing keys; tests generate synthetic identities at runtime. Source/CI builds omit runtime identity assets by default. Local release builds explicitly select an external asset directory. Publishing the APK makes its bundled identity extractable; building locally does not preserve that identity's confidentiality.
